## Technical Background
I am finishing up my bachelors in Computer Science at GVSU while also attending for a Masters in Applied Computer Science. I previously worked as a full stack software developer intern at EJ. 

## Projects
### [Decentralized SAS systems](https://stevenstreasick.github.io/GVSU-CIS641-Introverted/)
This project implemented a decentralized SAS system, where each part of the SAS had to cooperate with one another to achieve conflicting goals. In particular, one part of the SAS focused on achieving the highest framerate possible, while another part of the SAS system attempted to adjust the enemy difficulty, which by doing so would adjust the framerate. To ensure that these SAS systems coordinate with each other, one SAS system, in this example the framerate SAS, will contain an externally available happiness metric. Should the happiness of the framerate SAS system go down, then the enemy controller will choose to adapt in an attempt to improve the happiness of the framerate subsystem.
